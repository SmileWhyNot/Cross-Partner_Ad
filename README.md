# Cross-Partner_Ad

Ad for Syberry and Crealytics

I got a task to create a cross-partner ad for two companies
This task was for marketing communications lesson
I decided to combine working with marketing and programming

1. I have done slider for pictures
2. I made 2 slides in Canva for two companies
3. Put an ad into slider

The idea was to make a slider for touchscreen banners in the city
One company offers a competition for the best site for a foreign company
Invites authors of the best jobs for a technical interview
Best devs are sent to the foreign company on positions intern/junior
Foreign company pays first-one for site development
